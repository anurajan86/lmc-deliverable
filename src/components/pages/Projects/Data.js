We believe that restoring the ecosystem and preserving native wildlife specis will bring back some of the natural wonders of Atlanta, but we must also be sure to not unintentionally drive out current residents because of rising costs.',

      'We firstly need to define which parties and common people will be involved in this project and how to gather ideas from these participants effectively. Maintaining a “two-way” risk communication is important for us when conducting the project. We can select some officers who are also in the community to found an agency/committee, like The Unity Council in Fruitvale Transit Village Project, to collect suggestions and feedback periodically from the neighborhood. The agency is like a bridge between those who make the decision and the community, ensuring that both parties can communicate efficiently and adequately. This committee can ​​hold regular meetings, create posters, and provide webinars for the public frequently to make people participate in this project actively. By collecting ideas through the agency, both the project conductors and experts can understand what the majority of the community concerns and what they should pay more attention to. ',
